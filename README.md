Countdown Numbers Game
======================

This repository contains Python code to analyse the Countdown numbers game.

`search.py` contains functions that are used to find which numbers can be made.

Run `save.py` to make a file that says how to make each total from given numbers.
By default it uses 3,6,8,10,75,100.

Run `make_all.py` to find combinations of numbers that allow you to make all possible
totals.

WARNING: This code is very slow!
